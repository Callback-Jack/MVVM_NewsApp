### How to view the project: 

- you can either use my online demo page: https://android-app-demo-page.netlify.app.
(current account status only allow one user at a time, if the load fails or the queue is full, please just wait a bit and refresh the page)
- Or download the MVVM_NewsApp.apk file and install on an android device or a simulator.
- Or clone the project and open it in Android Studio.(I'm re-writing the project, the current version is incomplete, ***so please don't clone it***)

### Step-by-step project building:

1. Create XML layouts for NewsActivity, BreakingNewsFragment, SearchNewsFragment, SavedNewsFragment using `Recycler View`,
   design the layout for the item article of the list, and the layout for ArticleFragment with `WebView`.
